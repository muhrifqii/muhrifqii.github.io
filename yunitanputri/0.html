  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul
  can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the
  level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive
  for right. I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use
  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my
  lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I
  shall but love thee better after death. i carry your heart with me(i carry it in my heart)i am
  never without it(anywhere i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done by only me is your doing,my
  darling) i fear no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want no world(for beautiful you are my
  world,my true) and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always
  sing is you here is the deepest secret nobody knows (here is the root of the root and the bud of
